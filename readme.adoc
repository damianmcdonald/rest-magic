RestMagic is an abstraction layer that sits above the Spray/AKKA frameworks and provides developers with the ability to declaratively create RESTful web service mocks.

The intended audience are front-end developers who require real back-end endpoints and responses in order to progress their development but whom do not require a full-blown back-end implementation.

RestMagic comes bundled with several https://github.com/damianmcdonald/rest-magic/wiki/Http-Service-Config-Catalogue[pre-configured HTTP services] that should cover most development needs.

== Declarative Services

Let's dive straight into an example demonstrating how RESTful web services are created with RestMagic.

=== Hello World (Simple Rest)

No documentaton is complete without the ubiquitous "`Hello World`" example. Therefore, let's take a look at how we would implment a RESTful web service that returns _Hello World_ as a response.

[source,scala]
----
private val helloWorldApi = SimpleRestConfig(
  httpMethod = GET,
  apiPath = "restmagic" / "helloworld",
  produces = `application/json`,
  dataMode = Inline(),
  responseData = """{ "response": "Hello World" }"""
)
----

The example above demonstrates the declarative nature of RestMagic, allowing a developer to define a RESTful web service without concern as to internal implementation details.

This example:

* creates an endpoint at; http://localhost:8085/restmagic/helloworld
* accepts `GET` requests
* responds with the MIME type `application/json`
* responds with the literal value of `{ "response": "Hello World" }`

=== Hello World (Parameterized Rest)

Taking the concept of a RESTful web service a step further, is the `ParameterizedRestConfig`.

[source,scala]
----
private val helloWorldWithParameterApi = ParameterizedRestConfig(
  httpMethod = GET,
  apiPath = "restmagic" / "helloworld" / MATCH_PARAM,
  produces = `application/json`,
  dataMode = Inline(),
  responseData = Map(
    "english" -> """{ "response": "Hello World" }""",
    "turkish" -> """{ "response": "Merhaba Dunya" }""",
    "italian" -> """{ "response": "Salve Mondo" }""",
    "spanish" -> """{ "response": "Hola Mundo" }""",
    "german" -> """{ "response": "Halo Welt" }"""
  ),
  serveMode = ByParam()
)
----

This example:

* creates an endpoint at; http://localhost:8085/restmagic/helloworld/{{parameter}}
* accepts `GET` requests
* responds with the MIME type `application/json`
* responds with the value from the `responseData` Map, where Map _key_ == url _parameter_

The request; http://localhost:8085/restmagic/helloworld/spanish, would:

* respond with the MIME type `application/json`
* respind with the value `{ "response": "Hola Mundo" }`

== Next steps

Now that you have a feel for what RestMagic does, the next step would be to dive into the https://github.com/damianmcdonald/rest-magic/wiki[project documentation wiki].

If you are still not convinced about what RestMagic can do for you, you can take a look at https://github.com/damianmcdonald/action-figure-magic[action-figure-magic]. This is a _dog food_ application that uses RestMagic to create a fictitious web site and will give you a better feel for how it could be used in the wild.
